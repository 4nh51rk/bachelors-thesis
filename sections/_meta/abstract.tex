\section*{Abstract}

 This thesis contributes to the understanding of how to derive static control flow graphs from JavaScript programs for the purpose of enabling a variety of static data flow analyses. An algorithm is presented that defines how to systematically construct a control flow graph from a program's abstract syntax tree. Furthermore, some limitations of the approach are discussed that are inherent to the dynamic nature of JavaScript. Finally, an exemplary implementation serves as a proof of concept for the applicability of the control flow graph derivation algorithm.
