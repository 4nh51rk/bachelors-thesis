\subsubsection{Installation via npm}

Similar to the Styx core library, the Styx command-line interface is available via npm as well. It can be installed by running the following command:

\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=0.75cm]{text}
$ npm install --global styx-cli
\end{minted}

As part of the global installation, the Styx CLI has been added to the system's PATH environment variable. It can then be accessed by calling \texttt{styx} within a terminal. The available arguments are listed in detail in section \ref{sec:styx-cli-args} (``\nameref{sec:styx-cli-args}'').
