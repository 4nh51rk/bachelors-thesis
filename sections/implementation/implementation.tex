\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

As part of this thesis, the outlined algorithm for deriving control flow graphs has been implemented. The resulting JavaScript program consists of two main parts: the \textit{Styx}\footnote{The library was named after the river Styx, which in Greek mythology is believed to form the boundary between Earth and the Underworld.} core library that implements the control flow graph derivation (discussed in section \ref{sec:styx-corelib}) and a command-line application that provides a wrapper around the core library (discussed in section \ref{sec:styx-cli}).
