\subsection{Command-Line Interface}
\label{sec:styx-cli}

The \emph{Styx CLI} project provides a simple command-line interface that exposes the functionality of the Styx core library. It imports the Esprima \cite{esprima} parser and is therefore capable of loading a JavaScript file, generating its abstract syntax tree, and deriving a control flow graph from it.
