\subsection{Obtaining the Abstract Syntax Tree}

The algorithm for deriving static control flow graphs does not operate on the JavaScript program's raw source code, but on its abstract syntax tree. Therefore, a JavaScript parser is required to parse the program and return its abstract syntax tree, which then serves as the basis for control flow graph derivation. While the format of the abstract syntax tree can vary between parsers, the following sections assume the ESTree \cite{estree-spec} format (without loss of generality). ESTree describes a simple format that covers the entire ECMAScript 5.1 grammar, and it is implemented by popular open-source JavaScript parsers such as Acorn \cite{acorn} or Esprima \cite{esprima}. The control flow graph derivation library described in section \ref{sec:implementation} (``\nameref{sec:implementation}''), for instance, uses Esprima to obtain an abstract syntax tree in ESTree format.

\nameref{sec:appendix} shows an exemplary JavaScript program and its abstract syntax tree as generated by Esprima.
