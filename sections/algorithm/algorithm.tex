\section{Algorithm}
\label{sec:algorithm}

This section illustrates the algorithmic approach used to derive a static control flow graph from a JavaScript program. It describes the graph format and how to parse statements and expressions. This section also discusses techniques for simplifying negated conditions where possible.

\subsection{Deriving a Control Flow Graph}

Once the abstract syntax tree of a program has been generated, it can be traversed to successively construct the control flow graph.
