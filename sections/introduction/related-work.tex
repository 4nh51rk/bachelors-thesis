\subsection{Related Work}

Recently, there has been notable related work in the area of static control flow analysis. For instance, the Flow \cite{flow} type checker developed at Facebook aims to statically find type errors in JavaScript programs. Flow analyzes plain JavaScript code, which does not have to be explicitly decorated with type annotations. The latter can optionally be included, though, to gradually improve the significance of the type checker.

Additionally, \cite{kashyap2014jsai} presents a static analysis platform for JavaScript based on JSAI, an abstract interpreter that offers user-configurable sensitivity and provably sound analysis. Due to the dynamic nature of the language, however, much work is done in the area of dynamic analyses. \cite{bichhawat2014information}, \cite{hedin2012information}, and \cite{santos2014information}, for example, focus on improving the security of JavaScript applications through dynamic information flow control.
